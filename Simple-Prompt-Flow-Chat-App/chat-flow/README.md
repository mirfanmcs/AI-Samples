  chat_history:
    type: list
    default: []
    is_chat_input: false
    is_chat_history: true
  question:
    type: string
    default: What is the capital of France?
    is_chat_input: true
    is_chat_history: false

outputs:
  answer:
    type: string
    reference: ${chat.output}
    is_chat_output: true

nodes:
- name: chat
  type: llm
  source:
    type: code
    path: chat.jinja2

```

### Key Components

1. **Input Schema**
   - `question`: User's travel query (string, chat input)
   - `chat_history`: Previous conversation context (list, maintains session state)

2. **LLM Node Configuration**
   - **Model**: GPT-4o via Azure OpenAI
   - **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity and consistency)
   - **Max Tokens**: 256 (concise but comprehensive responses)
   - **Provider**: Azure OpenAI with enterprise security

3. **Output Schema**
   - `answer`: Generated travel advice and recommendations

## üéØ Travel Agent Capabilities

### Conversation Flow

The bot maintains conversation context through the `chat_history` parameter:

```json
{
  "question": "Follow-up question about Japan",
  "chat_history": [
    {
      "inputs": {"question": "When is the best time to visit Japan?"},
      "outputs": {"answer": "The best time to visit Japan depends on your preferences..."}
    }
  ]
}
```

## üé® Prompt Engineering

### Travel Agent Persona (`chat.jinja2`)

The prompt is engineered to create a professional travel agent experience:

```jinja
# system:
**Objective**: Assist users with travel-related inquiries, offering tips, advice, and recommendations as a knowledgeable travel agent.

**Capabilities**:
- Provide up-to-date travel information, including destinations, accommodations, transportation, and local attractions.
- Offer personalized travel suggestions based on user preferences, budget, and travel dates.
- Share tips on packing, safety, and navigating travel disruptions.
- Help with itinerary planning, including optimal routes and must-see landmarks.
- Answer common travel questions and provide solutions to potential travel issues.

**Instructions**:
1. Engage with the user in a friendly and professional manner, as a travel agent would.
2. Use available resources to provide accurate and relevant travel information.
3. Tailor responses to the user's specific travel needs and interests.
4. Ensure recommendations are practical and consider the user's safety and comfort.
5. Encourage the user to ask follow-up questions for further assistance.

{% for item in chat_history %}
# user:
{{item.inputs.question}}
# assistant:
{{item.outputs.answer}}
{% endfor %}

# user:
{{question}}
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Professional Tone** - Maintains travel agent expertise
2. **Context Awareness** - Uses chat history for personalized responses
3. **Safety First** - Prioritizes user safety and comfort
4. **Actionable Advice** - Provides specific, implementable recommendations
5. **Engagement** - Encourages follow-up questions and deeper planning

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Test Data Scenarios

#### Basic Travel Queries (`test_data.jsonl`)
- **Destination Planning**: Japan cherry blossoms, Australia timing
- **Budget Planning**: Thailand cost estimates, accommodation pricing
- **Documentation**: Europe visa requirements, travel documents
- **Specialized Travel**: Kenya safari packing, solo female travel safety
- **Transportation**: Tokyo to Mount Fuji routes, Amsterdam layovers

#### Conversation Tests (`test_data_with_history.jsonl`)
Progressive multi-turn conversation simulating real travel planning:
1. **Initial Query**: "I'm planning a trip to Japan. What's the best time to visit?"
2. **Follow-up**: "That sounds great! What are the must-see places in Tokyo?"
3. **Detailed Planning**: "How should I get around Tokyo? Is public transport good?"
4. **Budget Inquiry**: "What's the typical cost for accommodation in central Tokyo?"

### Test Scripts

#### Quick Validation (`quick_test.py`)
```python
# Simple validation of core functionality
pf = PFClient()
run = pf.run(flow=".", data="test_data.jsonl", stream=True)
details = pf.get_details(run)
# Displays first 3 results for quick verification
```

#### Comprehensive Testing (`test_chat_flow.py`)
Advanced test suite with multiple modes:
- **Basic Tests**: Individual questions without context
- **Conversation Tests**: Multi-turn dialogues with history
- **Performance Tests**: Response time measurement
- **Interactive Mode**: Real-time testing interface

### Test Execution

```pwsh
# Quick validation
python quick_test.py

# Full test suite
python test_chat_flow.py

# PromptFlow CLI testing
pf flow test --flow . --inputs question="What should I pack for a safari in Kenya?"
pf flow test --flow . --interactive --verbose

print(response.json()["answer"])
```

#### Chat Interface Integration
```python
class TravelChatSession:
    def __init__(self, endpoint_url, api_key):
        self.endpoint = endpoint_url
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.chat_history = []
    
    def ask_question(self, question):
        payload = {
            "question": question,
            "chat_history": self.chat_history
        }
        
        response = requests.post(
            self.endpoint,
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}"},
            json=payload
        )
        
        answer = response.json()["answer"]
        
        # Update chat history
        self.chat_history.append({
            "inputs": {"question": question},
            "outputs": {"answer": answer}

# Check detailed logs
pf run show-details --name [run-name]
```

### Debug Steps

1. **Validate Dependencies**
   ```pwsh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pf --version
   ```

2. **Test Connection**
   ```pwsh
   pf connection list
   pf connection show --name ai-foundry-resource_aoai
   ```

3. **Validate Flow**
   ```pwsh
   pf flow validate --flow .
   pf flow test --flow . --inputs question="Hello"
   ```

4. **Check Azure Resources**
